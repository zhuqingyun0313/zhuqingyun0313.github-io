						Filter Coffee
					</div>
					<!-- Some message from: https://www.sevenmiles.com.au/editorial/the-baristas-guide-to-filter-coffee/ -->
					<p>
						It's commonly known as filtering, using a filter paper or flannel filter, where the soluble material in the coffee ground dissolves in the water and runs down, where other grounds and impurities are filtered out.Another way to describe this category of brewing is ‘low-pressure brewing’, because that’s the one difference they all have compared to an espresso machine. Using low pressure in brewing is concentration. A typical espresso has a ratio of around 1:2 parts coffee to water while filter coffee sits around 1:16 parts coffee to water.
					</p>
					<p>
						Filter coffee with filter paper, or hand brew coffee, is probably the most used home coffee. Discard the coffee grounds and filter paper when you're done. Compared to espresso, the mouthfeel of filter coffee is less ‘thick’ and the flavours are more subtle & detailed.

								Coffee press
							</div>
							<br />
							<p>1.Warm the press and coffee cup with hot water.</p>
							<p>2.Pull out the pressure group of the pressure filter. Drain the water from the press and fill the pot with about 20 grams of coffee powder.</p>
							<p>3.The press is placed at a 45 degree Angle. Pour 200ml of hot water at about 95 degrees into the press slowly and let it stand for 3-4 minutes.</p>
							<p>4.Stir the coffee powder with a bamboo stick to allow the coffee grease to rise to the top.</p>
							<p>5.Cover the filter set, gently press down to the bottom, then pour the coffee into the warm coffee cup.</p>
							<p>6.Add as much milk or sugar as you like, and you can make a cup of freshly ground coffee!</p>

								Syphon
							</div>
							<p>
								Siphon coffee pot is the most common coffee pot in Taiwan and Japan. It is said that it was first invented by Robed Napier, a Scottish naval architect, and also appeared in Germany in 1830. Finally, the pot was continuously modified by France and Britain into two jars, using heating and atmospheric pressure to make water go up (hot air goes up). After the pot is closed, the coffee is filtered down (the cold air drops), and the coffee pot is finished soaking and filtering. The coffee pot is full of taste, and the producer is like a scientific researcher.

								Coffee Machine
							</div>
							
							<p>
								The principle of the coffee machine is to use a mixture of high-pressure steam and water to quickly pass through the coffee layer, and instantly extract the coffee. In this way, the coffee is hot, the content of caffeine and other impurities is very low, and the taste is rich. In the beginning, it was a semi-automatic coffee machine, which we used to call Italian coffee machine, because it originated in Italy and got its name. Today, Italian coffee machine has been fully automated. The machine initially grinds, presses, charges, brews, and removes the residue manually.
