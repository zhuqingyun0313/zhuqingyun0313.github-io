                <p>I first saw a paragraph in the middle of the page, and after a few seconds the page automatically jumped to the museum theme page. On the homepage, I was attracted by the bright red color at the first sight. Then I checked the navigation at the top, and the first side of the page showed all the information and addresses I wanted to know about the museum. Scroll down with mouse and I found all the information about the works of art now on display. The first piece of art on display was that of a famous artist, Picasso, and I clicked on it. What greeted my eyes was a piece of green and his works. I also saw a button under the picture of his works that could be converted into Chinese, which made it easier for me to read it. Then I used the navigation to read another information about half minute.</p>

                <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>First I paid attention whether the website has a good layout design, and I did a cursory search to see if there were any obvious interactive elements, such as whether the text changed when the mouse moved over the text box.</p>

                <h3>What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
                <br />  
                <p>The most time I spend is browsing what works of art are in the museum and the news and reading the detailed historical information of the works.</p>

                <h3>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>Click on each entry and navigation to see the text layout of each image. In my opinion, the layout and design of the website were worth learning.</p>
                <br />

                <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>In my first impression, this site focuses on telling visitors the museum's location information and opening hours. Tell you what works are on show in the museum recently and encourage you to buy tickets on site.</p> 
                <br />
                <h3>How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>The website used a very simple and nice website layout, with a picture and a paragraph of text to clearly express the museum's main recommended works of art and activities.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>In my opinion, this website doesn't need to take much time to interact with, because all information is very intuitive and easy to read. However, I would like to visit the website once every week or two, because the art on the museum site is well worth watching and knowing. </p>

                <h3>What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?</h3>
                <p>The whole site is mainly black and white, in the selection of pictures. Most of the images are chosen in bright colors. Not only that, but when opening the site, the viewer quickly realizes that all the layouts are visualized as rectangles. It refers to the article "Visual Hierarchy: Organizing Content to Follow Natural Eye Movement Patterns", and we can easily see the Visual structure of the website. The following two screenshots of the website clearly show the composition design of the 'Z' and 'E' word structure.</p>

                <h3>What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>When I create a website, I should have the overall layout design as the main purpose. Because of a good site layout design will have a good visual interaction effect and can give visitors which have a good visual experience. My research website which is a good example.</p>
                <br />
                <h3>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>The navigation was unclickable when I clicked the word - "SHOP" and change to store site, then I clicked the museum logo when I wanted to go back the main page. So I think this bug should not appear. Also, I don't think dark green and black should go together. Even though the visual interaction fit the eerie style of the artwork.</p>

                <br />
                <p>Without a doubt, the element I was most pleased with was the layout of the site. The square and simple layout makes me feel very comfortable. The text style also fits the style of the site.</p>
